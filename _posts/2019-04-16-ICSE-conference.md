I am happy to announce that we are going to participate in ICSE 2019 in Montréal. 

Our lab was very productive in 2018 year and we had two accepted papers in the conference (and co-located conferences), one student volunteer, and two students on the [mentorship workshop program](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Software-Engineering-Mentoring-Workshop).

We look forward to see you there!
