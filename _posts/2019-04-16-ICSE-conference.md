I am happy to announce that we are going to participate in ICSE 2019 in Montréal. 

Our lab was very productive in 2018 year and we have two papers accepted in the conference (and co-located conferences), one student volunteer, and two students on the [mentorship workshop program](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Software-Engineering-Mentoring-Workshop).

We look forward to meet you and share our knowledge and valuable experience to help make the world a better place together.
